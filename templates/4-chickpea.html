            <h1>CHICKPEA</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Chickpea crops are best suited to well-drained loam and clay loam soils that are neutral to alkaline (pH 6.0 to 9.0) and have good water holding capacity. Sowing will vary between varieties, but can start as early as mid May to the start of July. It is ideal to plant 40 to 50 plants per square meter.</p> 
            <p>Relative humidity of 21-41% is optimum for seed setting. The plants grow well in areas with annual rainfall between 600 - 1000 mm. </p>
            <p>Chickpea is sensitive to high (maximum daily temperature >35°C) as well as low (mean of maximum and minimum daily temperatures less than 15°C) temperatures at the reproductive stage. Both extremes of temperatures lead to flower drop and reduced pod set.</p>
