            <h1>RICE</h1>
            <br><hr>
            <p>Rice is the most important food crop of India covering about one-fourth of the total cropped area and providing food to about half of the Indian population. Punjab has made tremendous progress in rice productivity and production during the past 45 years. Due to use of high yielding varieties and new technology Punjab has given the title of "Rice Bowl of India".</p>
            <p>Rice is a Kharif crop. The major soil groups where rice is grown are riverine alluvium, red-yellow, red loamy, hill and sub-montane, Terai, laterite, costal alluvium, red sandy, mixed red, black, medium and shallow black soils. It grows well in soils having a pH range between 5.5 and 6.5.</p>
            <p>Moist humid weather during vegetative growth and dry-sunny weather during ripening is most desirable. A relative humidity of 60-80 % is said to be optimum. Rice requires high temperature above 25-degree Celsius and high humidity with annual rainfall above 100 cm to grow.</p>
